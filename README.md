EARTHQUAKE PREDICTION MODEL USING PYTHON

In this section we going to provide the dependencies/package installation and contents of our project.

1.INTRODUCTION

We are did a project which predicts the earthquake.here we have used linear regression,support vector machine and random forest
which gives better accuracy of our model.it gives above 80% accuracy.

2.PREREQUISITES

List the prerequisites and dependencies for running the project. Include instructions on how to install these dependencies.
Dependencies needed:
  
  1.Numpy
  2.Pandas
  3.Seaborn
  4.Sci-kit learn
  5.Matplotlib
  6.Linear regression model
  7.SVM
  8.Random forest

Instructions to download these dependencies

1.Numpy:
  If you use pip, you can install NumPy with:
  "pip install numpy"
  
2.Pandas
  Pandas can be installed via pip from PyPI.
  "pip install pandas"
  
3.Seaborn
  Official releases of seaborn can be installed from PyPI:
  "pip install seaborn"

4.Sci-kit learn
  Sklearn can be installed via pip from PyPI
  "pip install scikit-learn"

5.Matplotlib
  Matplotlib releases are available as wheel packages for macOS, Windows and Linux on PyPI. Install it using pip:
  "python -m pip install -U pip
  python -m pip install -U matplotlib"

6.Linear regression model
  Here we going to import thr model only by using the sci-kit learn library
  "from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression"

7.SVM
  Here we going to import thr model only by using the sci-kit learn library.
  "from sklearn.svm import SVR"
